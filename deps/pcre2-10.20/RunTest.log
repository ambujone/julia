Test 0: Unchecked pcre2test argument tests (to improve coverage)
  OK
Test 1: Main non-UTF, non-UCP functionality (compatible with Perl >= 5.10)
  OK
  OK with JIT
Test 2: API, errors, internals, and non-Perl stuff (excluding UTF-8)
  OK
  OK with JIT
Cannot test locale-specific features - none of the 'fr_FR', 'fr_CA',
'fr' or 'french' locales can be set, or the "locale" command is
not available to check for them.
 
Test 4: UTF-8 and Unicode property support (compatible with Perl >= 5.10)
  OK
  OK with JIT
Test 5: API, internals, and non-Perl stuff for UTF-8 and UCP support
  OK
  OK with JIT
Test 6: DFA matching main non-UTF, non-UCP functionality
  OK
Test 7: DFA matching with UTF-8 and Unicode property support
  OK
Test 8: Internal offsets and code size tests
  OK
Test 9: Specials for the basic 8-bit library
  OK
  OK with JIT

  Skipped when running 8-bit tests
Test 12: Specials for the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries UTF and UCP support
  Skipped when running 8-bit tests
Test 13: DFA specials for the basic 16-bit and 32-bit libraries

Test 14: Non-JIT limits and other non-JIT tests
  OK
Test 15: JIT-specific features when JIT is not available
  Skipped because JIT is available
Test 16: JIT-specific features when JIT is available
